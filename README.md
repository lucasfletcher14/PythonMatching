MUST HAVE PILLOW INSTALLED TO USE
(if you have trouble, what worked for me is this:
run 'python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip' in the terminal
then run 'python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow' in the terminal

I have a Macbook, which throws the error DS_Store (just a file it tries to read as an image)
to fix this, run 'rm -f .DS-Store' in the terminal
This issue was specific to me because of Mac, you may not need to do that.
